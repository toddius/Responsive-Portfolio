# Responsive-Portfolio
Homework #2

Since all three pages have the same format, I created the body once and copied it to the other two pages. The only thing that is different for each page is the main content. 

In the index file, the main content is formatted as a sction with an article in it to format the content. 

In the contact file, the main content is a form to get the users name, email address and a mesage they may want to leave.

In the portfolio file, the container has multiple rows, with two images each, for future portfolio entries.

The site was designed to be responsive to different device screen sizes. When the window shrinks, the menu in the navbar becomes a toggler drop down menu. The margins also decrease till the content fills the entire screen on xs screens. 

A sticky footer was added to each page.

A style sheet was created for additional effects not provided by Bootstrap. It adds a background image, color, font styles and modifies some padding and margins for different elements.

Each file has comments explaining what the code does.
