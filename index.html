            <p class="">Welcome to my home page! My name is Todd Walls and I'd like to share some information aboout myself. I grew up in northeastern US and moved to Colorado when I enrolled in University of Colorado Boulder. I earned my Bachelors in Chemical Engineering. After graduation, I helped my father establish and run his chemical manufacturing facility, Diversitec. I worked for him for 5 years and chose to move on. I went back to school at Colorado State Univdrsity Fort Collins to earn my Master in Education and teaching certificate. I taught in Denevr for 4 years. I needed a change and moved to Los Angeles. I lived there for 9 years. I met my wife adn we had two children. We moved to Colorado and I taught for the same School District, but at a different high school. After 19 years, it is time for me to change careers. 
            </p>
          
            <p>I am very excited to be in the Full Stack Coding Boot Camp through the University of Denver. It's fun to be a student again and learning everything to be a new coder. I enjoy the challenge of problem solving and the process of creation available trough coding. I look forward to my first position and the ability to expand my knowledge and skills.</p>
